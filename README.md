### Hi, I'm Arvin Bostani â€” Full-Stack Developer | Cyber Security Enthusiast

I'm a 21-year-old self-taught developer who loves building, breaking, and rebuilding things with code.  
From crafting powerful backend systems in **Laravel** to designing modern UIs with **React.js**, I build software with passion and precision.  
When I'm not coding, I'm diving deep into **cybersecurity**, testing vulnerabilities, and learning how to build safer systems.

**Tech Stack:** 
"Programming-languages"
`PHP` `JavaScript` `C#.net` `C++` `Pyhton`
"Frameworks-and-libraries"  
`Laravel` `React.js` `Next.js` `Bootstrap` `TailwindCSS`
"Databases" 
`MySQL` `SqlServer` `NoSql`
"Development-Tool"
`Composer` `Node.js` `Postman` `RestAPI` `Git` `Docker`
"Operating-System"
`Kali-linux` `Parrot-linux` `Fedora`
"Scurity-tools"
`Metasploit` `Nmap` `Burp-suite` `Hydra` `SqlMap` `Wireshark` `My-own-php-scripts`

**Currently focusing on:**  
- Growing my GitHub portfolio  
- Building complicated projects
- Building & Breaking stuff (ethically)
- Becoming a top-tier full-stack developer

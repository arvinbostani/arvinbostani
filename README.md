### Hi, I'm Arvin Bostani — Full-Stack Developer | Cyber Security Enthusiast

I'm a 21-year-old self-taught developer who loves building, breaking, and rebuilding things with code.  
From crafting powerful backend systems in **Laravel** to designing modern UIs with **React.js**, I build software with passion and precision.  
When I'm not coding, I'm diving deep into **cybersecurity**, testing vulnerabilities, and learning how to build safer systems.

**Tech Stack:**  
`PHP` `JavaScript` `Laravel` `React.js` `Next.js` `Node.js`  
`MySQL` `MariaDB` `Git` `Docker` `Kali Linux`  

**Currently focusing on:**  
- Growing my GitHub portfolio  
- Building real-world projects  
- Becoming a top-tier full-stack developer
